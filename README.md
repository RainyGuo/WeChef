### Problem Statement 

Have you ever found yourself standing in the kitchen with a handful of
ingredients that you have no idea what to do with? Oftentimes, just finding
the correct recipes can be a hassle. Our team is envisioning a convenient and
user-friendly mobile app called WeChef as the solution to this problem.

The mobile app will provide individuals with an easy way to discover new
recipes as well as find recipes based on the current available ingredients at
hand. In addition, WeChef will allow individuals to live stream their cooking
sessions for the general public to view and learn from them. They will also be
able to upload videos for individuals who prefer to learn at their own pace.

What makes us stand out from our competitors, such as Tasty, is that our app
is user-based, whereby anyone can upload their recipes. Tasty, on the other
hand, is fully controlled by the professional editors, and users can only view
the recipes posted by them.

In conclusion, our app aims to provide a platform for anyone who aspires to
improve their cooking skills and we hope to grow a fun and friendly community
for cooking enthusiasts.
